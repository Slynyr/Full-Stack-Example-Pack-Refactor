 * A class to create User objects from PDO fetch statements. 
 * Note that there is no constructor. If you provide a constructor, it must
 * not require any parameters, or the fetch will fail.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: The names of the fields (instance variables) must match the
 * column names from the SELECT query in order for this to work. If there
 * is a mismatch, it will fail silently. The objects will be created,
 * but with null values for the mismatched fields.
