 * Returns a json-encoded list of User objects drawn from a database. It
 * does this by building and encodes an associative array. Because JavaScript
 * objects are also associative arrays, the decoded result can be treated like
 * an object in JavaScript.
 * 
 * Use the grades table (grades.sql) from the example pack, and make sure you 
 * change connect.php in the server folder to use your correct login 
 * information.
